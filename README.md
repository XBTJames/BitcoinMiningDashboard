# XBTJames Bitcoin Mining Dashboard

This is a Dashboard I have made to look at some Bitcoin mining data at a glance, leveraging the tools from Luxor's Hashrateindex API. There is ERCOT pricing data that works fine locally but does not work on Heroku.

To run this dashboard locally, clone this repository to your machine, add your API key on line 16 of app.py, and run. Locally you should be able to see the ERCOT hub and load zone pricing data.
